# Veneer Controller Configuration Example
#
# This file shows all available configuration options with their default values.
# Copy this to config.yaml and modify as needed.

# Prometheus URL for querying Lumina metrics
# Can be overridden with VENEER_PROMETHEUS_URL environment variable
prometheusUrl: "http://prometheus:9090"

# Log level: debug, info, warn, or error
# Default: info
# Can be overridden with VENEER_LOG_LEVEL environment variable
logLevel: "info"

# Metrics endpoint bind address
# Default: :8080
# Can be overridden with VENEER_METRICS_BIND_ADDRESS environment variable
metricsBindAddress: ":8080"

# Health probe endpoint bind address
# Default: :8081
# Can be overridden with VENEER_HEALTH_PROBE_BIND_ADDRESS environment variable
healthProbeBindAddress: ":8081"

# Overlay management configuration
overlays:
    # Disabled mode creates NodeOverlays with an impossible requirement that
    # prevents them from matching any nodes. This allows testing overlay creation
    # in a cluster without affecting Karpenter's provisioning decisions.
    #
    # When disabled: overlays include a requirement for "veneer.io/disabled: true"
    # which no node will have, so they never match.
    #
    # Default: false (overlays are active and will affect Karpenter)
    # Can be overridden with VENEER_OVERLAY_DISABLED environment variable
    # or --overlay-disabled CLI flag
    disabled: false
