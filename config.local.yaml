# Veneer Controller - Local Development Configuration
#
# This file is used for local development with `make run`.
# It expects you to port-forward to Prometheus:
#
#   kubectl port-forward -n prometheus svc/prometheus 9090:9090
#
# Then run: make run

# Prometheus URL pointing to localhost (assumes port-forward)
prometheusUrl: "http://localhost:9090"

# Debug logging for local development
logLevel: "debug"

# Default bind addresses
metricsBindAddress: ":8080"
healthProbeBindAddress: ":8081"

# AWS configuration - must match LocalStack/Lumina setup
aws:
    accountId: "000000000000"
    region: "us-west-2"

# Overlay management configuration
overlays:
    # Delete overlays when utilization reaches 95%
    utilizationThreshold: 95.0

    # Overlay weights (higher = higher priority)
    weights:
        reservedInstance: 30 # Highest priority (instance-type specific)
        ec2InstanceSavingsPlan: 20 # Medium priority (family-specific)
        computeSavingsPlan: 10 # Lowest priority (global)
