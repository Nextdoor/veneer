# Karve Controller - Local Development Configuration
#
# This file is used for local development with `make run`.
# It expects you to port-forward to a Prometheus instance:
#
#   kubectl port-forward -n lumina-system svc/lumina-prometheus 9090:9090
#
# Then run: make run

# Prometheus URL pointing to localhost (assumes port-forward)
prometheusUrl: "http://localhost:9090"

# Debug logging for local development
logLevel: "debug"

# Default bind addresses
metricsBindAddress: ":8080"
healthProbeBindAddress: ":8081"

# Overlay management configuration
overlayManagement:
  # Delete overlays when utilization reaches 95%
  utilizationThreshold: 95.0

  # Overlay weights (higher = higher priority)
  weights:
    reservedInstance: 30        # Highest priority (instance-type specific)
    ec2InstanceSavingsPlan: 20  # Medium priority (family-specific)
    computeSavingsPlan: 10      # Lowest priority (global)
